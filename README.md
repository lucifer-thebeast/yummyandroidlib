# yummyandroidlib

Source code of  https://github.com/lucifer-thebeast/yummymultiplatformpackage.
This is a Kotlin Multiplatform library which can be shared to Android iOS apps that wants to query recipes from Yummly.

Will add more use case soon. See GetRecipeListCommand class. Its the only use case for now.
